# Surfs Up - Module 9 Challenge 
## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
### Purpose
For this challenge we were tasked with analyzing the temperature data in Oahu, Hawaii, specifically for the months of June and December. This weather analysis will assist in solidifying W.Avy's decision in investing in our Surf and Shake shop. We've aleady reviewed the precipitation data for the area and determined that the rain should not be an issue with the success of the business. 

Looking at the overall statistical data for temperature, we want to take into consideration the different seasonal months of the year, so for this analysis we will compare the summary temperatures of June and December. In this analysis, we are hoping that though the months change, the average temperature stay relatively similar, enough to still be warm enough to provoke locals and tourists alike to visit the shop and enjoy ice cream. 

## Results
### Major Points:
- The max temperature is 2 degrees higher in June than December
- The average temperature is 3 degrees higher in June than December 
- The 25/50/75 percentiles are lower in December, but not significantly. At maximum, a 5 degree difference 


## Summary
Overall, after reviewing the statistical data for temperature in June and December, there is only a slight decrease in overall temperature highs in December. In this analysis, we see there only being a two degree different in maximum temperatures. More importantly our temperature percentiles do not shift significantly for Hawaii weather in December. We have found there to only be a five degree difference between the two months. We have also conducted two additional queries to further our analysis of the weather data in June and December. 
### Additional Query #1
In addition to the analysis we have already completed, we would find it important to also determine the frequency of these temperatures that are occuring during these two months. Below we have queried the June and December temperature dataframes to show us this information. The frequency allows us to see what we can anticipate most days to feel like. In our case, we see that both of these months have maximum temperatures in the 80s, but after looking at the frequency, the maximun temperature does not happen often.

### Additional Query #2
The final query we completed was analyzing specifically June and December for their precipitation totals. The snapshots capture the count of days of recorded rainfall for the first 25 rows. It gives us confidence to see majority of days in each of these months at or close to zero rainfall. This information also allows us to understand what to expect and allows us to prepare our business plan around the weather trends.

This overall analysis reveals the area's stable temperatures and unconcerning precipitation totals throughout the year. We will be able to present this information to W.Avy to support that the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round.
